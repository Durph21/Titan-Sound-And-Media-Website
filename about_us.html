                    'Titan Sound and Media' was founded by Cork based duo Pierce McNulty and Darragh Murphy. From a young age both were fascinated by the art of expression through creative media. Pierce has a deep rooted passion for photography which he has nurtured for years. He has blossomed into a talented young photographer and more recently an adept film maker, rarely seen without a camera around his neck. Darragh on the other hand has always been more in tune with everything sound. From music to podcasts to sound design his wide variety of talents allows him to contribute something to nearly any project. Similarly, he too enjoys the challenge and creative expression in film making. Together they have collaborated on many projects culminating in the creation of 'Titan Sound and Media'.
